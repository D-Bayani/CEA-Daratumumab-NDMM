Instructions per chapter below:

Partitioned Survival Analysis: Patient-level data or pseudo patient-level data must be available for each trial. To generate pseudo patient-level data, a digitizer software must be used together with the validated algorithm by Guyot, et al. This can also be constructed via this link: https://www.trialdesign.org/one-page-shell.html#IPDfromKM

Risk Analysis: The code for running a probabilistic sensitivity analysis on R using the partitioned survival model is presented below. For each scenario or scheme implemented, a different .csv file must be saved for parameter values, costs, and outcomes. The outputs may be uploaded onto https://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/ to generate the EVPI/P-SUB outputs.
